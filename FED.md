    * Object options for your project rules on Configfile.js?
    SASS Lint has default configuration rules
    * if you provide one it attempts to merge everything except for the files on section below.
    If you pass options directly into the plugin they take precedence.
    sassLint config order: options > config file > SassLint default included config.

    * You can disable this behaviour by setting merge-default-rules to false within the options.options object that you pass to gulp-sass-lint or you can include it in your config file options that you can pass into gulp-sass-lint with options.configFile.
